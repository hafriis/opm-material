 * \ingroup FluidMatrixInteractions
 * \brief Implementation of the regularized Brooks-Corey capillary
 *        pressure / relative permeability <-> saturation relation.
 *
 * This class bundles the "raw" curves as static members and doesn't
 * concern itself converting absolute to effective saturations and
 * vice versa.
 *
 * In order to avoid very steep gradients the marginal values are
 * "regularized".  This means that in stead of following the curve of
 * the material law in these regions, some linear approximation is
 * used.  Doing this is not worse than following the material
 * law. E.g. for very low wetting phase values the material laws
 * predict infinite values for \f$p_c\f$ which is completely
 * unphysical. In case of very high wetting phase saturations the
 * difference between regularized and "pure" material law is not big.
 *
 * Regularizing has the additional benefit of being numerically
 * friendly: Newton's method does not like infinite gradients.
 *
 * The implementation is accomplished as follows:
 * - check whether we are in the range of regularization
 *   - yes: use the regularization
 *   - no: forward to the standard material law.
 *
